# Administration panel mockup

This is a one page (for now) mockup of what could be the back-office control panel of one of my project. I open source in case of anyone is interested in using and customizing it.

## Installation

This project use [Compass](http://compass-style.org/) to preprocess CSS and [bower](http://bower.io) for depedency management.

To compile the CSS and install the dependencies, run the following commands.

```bash
bower install
compass compile
```
